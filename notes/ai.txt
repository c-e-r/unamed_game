attack
buff
    check if it alreay has that buff
debuff
    check if you have that debuff
heal
    only use if not at full health

what if it choses item but theres only 1 buff item that it has already used?


getAvailiableSkills() method will return an array list with only skils it will use and thats the list checked in the first step

should it be possible to use the same thing twice in a row?
